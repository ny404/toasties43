          <p>18. Right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor</p>

          <p>18.1. Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to the Regulation, each data subject has the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under the Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with the Regulation.</p>

          <p>18.2. Proceedings against a controller or a processor are brought before the courts of the Member State where the Controller or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence, unless the Controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers.</p>

          <p>19. Representation of data subjects</p>

          <p>19.1. The data subject has the right to mandate a not-for-profit body, organisation or association which has been properly constituted in accordance with the law of a Member State, has statutory objectives which are in the public interest, and is active in the field of the protection of data subjects' rights and freedoms with regard to the protection of their personal data to lodge the complaint on his or her behalf, to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 16, 17 and 18 and to exercise the right to receive compensation referred to in the Regulation on his or her behalf where provided for by Member State law.</p>

          <p>19.2. Member States may provide that any body, organisation or association referred to in paragraph 19.1 of this Article, independently of a data subject's mandate, has the right to lodge, in that Member State, a complaint with the supervisory authority which is competent pursuant to Article 16 and to exercise the rights referred to in Articles 17 and 18 if it considers that the rights of a data subject under the Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing.</p>

          <p>20. Right to compensation and liability</p>

          <p>20.1. Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of the Regulation has the right to receive compensation from the Controller or processor for the damage suffered.</p>

          <p>20.2. Any controller involved in processing is liable for the damage caused by processing which infringes this Regulation. The processor is liable for the damage caused by processing only where it has not complied with obligations of the Regulation specifically directed to processors or where it has acted outside or contrary to lawful instructions of the Controller.</p>

          <p>20.3. The controller or processor shall be exempt from liability under paragraph 20.2 if it proves that it is not in any way responsible for the event giving rise to the damage.</p>

          <p>20.4. Where more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor, are involved in the same processing and where they are, under paragraphs 20.2. and 20.3, responsible for any damage caused by processing, each controller or processor shall be held liable for the entire damage in order to ensure effective compensation of the data subject.</p>

          <p>20.5. Where a controller or processor has, in accordance with paragraph 20.4., paid full compensation for the damage suffered, that controller or processor shall be entitled to claim back from the other controllers or processors involved in the same processing that part of the compensation corresponding to their part of responsibility for the damage, in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 18.2.</p>

          <p>20.6. Court proceedings for exercising the right to receive compensation is brought before the courts competent under the law of the Member State referred to in 18.2.</p>

          <p>21. Withdrawal of the consent</p>

          <p>Where the processing is based on: i) the consent of the data subject given for processing his/her personal data for one or more specific purposes; or ii) the consent of the data subject given for processing certain special personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition to process special personal data may not be lifted by the data subject, the data subject has the right to withdraw the consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on the consent before its withdrawal. For the sake of clarity the withdrawal of the consent shall not affect the processing of the personal data based on other legal basis.</p>

          <p>Category 1 &mdash; Strictly Necessary Cookies</p>

          <p>These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around Controller's web application and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without these cookies services like shopping baskets or e-billing cannot be provided.</p>

          <p>Category 4 - Targeting cookies or advertising cookies</p>

          <p>These cookies will usually be third-party cookies, although if a user is visiting the advertising network&rsquo;s own website it is technically possible these could be first party. They will always be persistent but time-limited cookies. These cookies can be associated with services provided by the third party but this is not always the case. These cookies contain a unique key that is able to distinguish individual users&rsquo; browsing habits or that can be translated into a set of browsing habits or preferences using information stored elsewhere. Generally speaking, the privacy statement should indicate if the cookie is being used as part of an advertising network. Cookies may also be used to limit the number times a user sees a particular ad on a website and to measure the effectiveness of a particular campaign.</p>

          <p>Examples include:</p>

          <p>&bull; Cookies placed by advertising networks to collect browsing habits in order to target relevant adverts to the user. The site the user is visiting need not actually be serving adverts, but often this will also be the case.</p>

          <p>&bull; Cookies placed by advertising networks in conjunction with a service implemented by the website to increase functionality, such as commenting on a blog, adding a site to the user&rsquo;s social network, providing maps or counters of visitors to a site.</p>

          <p>By default, the web ordering application and its originating website URL is not serving category 4 cookies. However, it may be possible to order online from other websites that frame-in or facilitate access to the online menu and web application. Therefore, please always check the cookie policy of the visited website from which you initiated an online ordering session in order to find out if any category 4 cookies are served and which is the way to opt-out or opt-in for them, as the legal case may be.</p>
